## GRASP Principles Summery

### Creator
Helps to decide which class should be responsible for creating a new instance of a class.

### Information Expert
Similer to the Single Responsibility Principle from SOLID, you should assign a responsibility to the class which has the information necessary to fulfill that responsibility.

### Low Coupling
Lowers the measure of how strongly one element is connected to, has knowledge of, or relies on other elements. 

### High Cohesion
The responsibilities of a given class are all related and highly focused around a single goal.

### Controller
Delegates how data is passed through classes to render objects (as from a database or user forms on webpages).

### Indirection
Assigning the responsibility of mediation between two clases to an intermediate class.

### Polymorphism
Variation of behavior within the same methods accross differing implementations of base classes or interfaces.

### Protected Variation
Make some elements immutible outside a subsystem to avoid the impact of variation on other elements.

### Pure Fabrication
A class that does not represent a concept in the problem domain (to support high cohesion, low coupling, and reuse).
