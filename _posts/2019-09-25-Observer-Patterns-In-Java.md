`java.beans` is a library that contains property methods that allow us to observe objects in Java.

> The object which is being watched is called the subject. The objects which are watching the state changes are called observers or listeners. [[1]](https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/DesignPatternObserver/article.html)

Two examples are:
* `import java.beans.PropertyChangeEvent;`
* `import java.beans.PropertyChangeListener;`
