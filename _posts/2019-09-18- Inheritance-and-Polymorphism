Week 1 Day 3 Homework.

For our homework today I thought of shared characteristics between a Vitamix and a KitchenAid Mixer. They are both Food Mixers, with a Capacity of food it can process, and an adjustable Speed. Individually they have different Brands, Colors, and Mixing Tools (blade vs. scraper). Food Mixers inherit characteristics from Countertop Appliances, such as Power (turn on / off), Portability, and must be run at the user's invoking. Toasters, Electric Can Openers, and Air Fryers also have these properties in common.
